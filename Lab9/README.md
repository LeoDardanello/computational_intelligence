# Black Box Optimization

The objective of the assignment is to optimize the problem with dimension 1,2,5 and 10 treating it as black box.

From some experimental run it is possible to observe that for higher dimension of the problem it converges too quickly. To avoid this behavoiur several techniques were implemented to improve the diversity and postpone the convergence.

# Results

With the techiniques used in the final version it is possible to solve the given problem with dimension 1 and 2
