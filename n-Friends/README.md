# n-Friends
An extension of a case study explained in the Computational Intelligence course at Polito

Problem Description:

During a night out a group of friends want to go from from a pizzeria to a pub but they don't have a car. They can use a tandem that can carry 2 people.
The friends are divided in Computer Engineers and Data Scientist, if the number of Computer Engineers is greather than the number of Data Scientist the Computer Engineers will start talking about nerd stuff and bore to death the poor Data Scientists, thus doomning the evening.
Is there a way to transport all the friends from the pizzeria to the pub using the tandem without dooming the night out?

Extensions:

-The number of Computer Engineers and Data Scientists can be different 

-The number of people that the tandem can carry is now modifiable by the user (tandem_size>0)

-It is possible to only consider the maximum dimension of the tandem when moving people (i.e tandem_size=4, the tandem will always carry 4 people)
